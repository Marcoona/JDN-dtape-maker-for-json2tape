# JDN-dtape-maker-for-json2tape
Hello guys! this is my first tool i ever made in python üòç
i hope yall like it and find this use full

REQUIRMENTS:
Python (duh) (the download to python: https://www.python.org/downloads/) also you have to download python to your PATH

REMEMBER: if you use my tool in your mods please credit me(marcoona), thanks.

HOW TO USE:
ok so if you start the tool it will ask you for the codename, you will just type the codename (for example:RunTheNight)
then it will ask you for the coach (input) moves, basically this is needed for the json file, if you have trio dance for example you need to do a dtape for every dancer
if you want to do a dtape for the first coach you have to type "0", if you want to do a dtape for the secound coach you have to type "1", if you want to do a dtape for the third dancer you have to type "2", if you want to do a dtape for 4th dancer you have to type "3".
i think i dont have to explain the rest..
i have made this tool because 1. i couldnt find a jdn dtape maker tool 2.because i have used diego's (moonlight_17) tool and its broken and i had to type the 
duration....... i am to lazy to do math so i have added an endtime to my tool and it will do the math automaticly
